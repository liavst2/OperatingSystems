===================================

Our Cache is an independent unit in our implementation.
In CachingFileSystem.cpp the functions that call the cache
are read and ioctl only. 
Read calls the "collect" function which retrieves the wanted
information from the cache. Given the offset and the size
to read, collect calculates the starting and ending block 
indexes to search in the cache. If the block doesnt exists,
collect calls the private function _cache_add to add this block
to the cache. If the block exists, collect calls _cache_replace
to place the current block on top of the Cache container.
All these blocks are placed in array, ordered by their 
sequential access. Then we start to copy the content of the
blocks to "buf" using memcpy, and the wanted offset and size.

In ioctl, the cache simply summons the logfile on each block
in its repository. The logfile writes the block information
down.

=            ANSWERS              =
===================================


1. We know that accessing the disk is way slower than accessing
     the memory because the memory is physically closer to the
     cpu. In this excersice we store our information on the heap.
     If the heap is located in the RAM, it will be more efficient to 
     read from it. But if the heap is located elsewhere, then our
     cache advantage will be lost. Also, searching in the cache may
     take time too if we are handling large amount of filele


2. In class, we saw there is a trade-off between sophisticated
     algorithm and a fast cache management. We require minimum
     time to handle a buffer cache managed by the OS because it
     is constantly changing.


3. LRU is better:
     files -> test1, test2, test3
     read ->  
     test1, 
     test1, 
     test2, 
     test2, 
     test3, 
     test3, 

     LFU is better:
     Files -> test 1, test 2, test 3, test 4.
     read ->
     test 1
     test 2
     test 3
     test 1
     test 1
     test 1
     test 1
     test 1
     test 2
     test 3
     test 4


     Niether is better:
     Files -> test 1, test 2, test 3, test 4.

     Read: 
     test 1
     test 2
     test 3
     test 4
     test 1
     test 2
     test 3
     test 4



4. Because there can be an intensive use in the same 
     segment for a short period of time(This is called
     the locality principle as we saw) and then wont be
     in use anymore. That can happen to a block in the 
     new section, increasing the block's reference count
     wont achieve this goal.
