Part 2: Theoretical Questions:
=============================
 
1.  Kernel level threads, unlike processes, share most of its context
    with the rest of the threads. Due to that, threads are 
    fundamentally designed to work together with other threads since
    all threads have complete access to the processes heep, code, 
    global variables etc. In other words, unlike processes, threads 
    are not independent of one another.
    A tab in a browser could be implemented with a kernel level thread
    but it seems pointless since there is no reason to assume tabs are
    dependent one of the other and its not logical to give each tab 
    the ability to access and change info of other threads.
    Besides that, a process tend to have more memory to use since by 
    implementing threads, memory is needed for the PCB.

    Kernel level threads and processes have in common that they are
    not blocked when a single process or thread get blocked (unlike 
    user level threads) and that they can take advantage of 
    multiprocessing.

    Kernel level threads minimize context switching in comparison to 
    processes and thus lowers the general overhead. In addition, since
    they share memory, kernel level threads can communication 
    considerably fast and efficiently.

    On the other hand, processes tend to manage memory more 
    efficiently since there is no need of a PCB for each internal 
    thread. And as stated before, even though processes can cope with 
    each other, unlike threads they do not have to share memory and
    information, making the process potentially autonomous and  
    independent. The latter is important since there is no impact on 
    other processes in case of failure, in contrast to threads. 


2.  We chose to send the kill signal to "pluma" (with the pid 27469). 
    The kill signal is a tool to communicate with other processes 
    using a signal. by typing "kill 27469", which by default sends the 
    SIGTERM signal to the process, we send the kill signal which by 
    definition cannot be handled by a process which then is handled by
    the OS terminating the process.  


3.  Real time, is the physical time as we know it. Virtual time is 
    defined by the ability to manipulate the fixed beginning of time 
    as we wish. It can be stopped, reset, extended and done with 
    whatever we want, since it does not represent the physical world.
    Real time can be used for example to measure the time a function 
    is executed (like we did in ex1) and virtual time can be used to 
    schedule the run of user-level threads (like we are doing in this 
    exercise).


4a. When using fork, a child process is spawned. The child process is
    an exact duplicate of its parent process meaning all the data in
    the global variables, stack and heap is identical at the spawning
    point, but it is physically not the same memory, stored in
    different locations, thus not shared, so from that point on, none
    of the above is common between the processes.


4b. A pipe is an implementation of a communication channel for 
    processes. It contains an array with only 2 slots where one slot 
    is exclusively for writing data and the other is exclusively for 
    reading data. The array is connected to the FDs Table in a way 
    that two processes can communicate.
    since processes are mostly autonomous and they do not share 
    memory, the pipe is needed for complex communication between 
    processes other than just signal communication like kill.
