======================================

1.  In the function measureTimes, we didn't allocate memory for
	"machineName", so the program terminated with segmentation fault.
	(it worked on Code::Blocks, but on Clion it threw seg fault)
	therefore, we added the following line:
	"times.machineName = new char[HOST_LEN]; " where 
	HOST_LEN = 1024 (on line 208 in osm.cpp).
	That fixed the problem.

2.  Also, there were "operation has no effect" warnings in the 
	makefile compilation (because of the operation_time function).
	So we added the specific "-Wno-unused-value" flag to suppress them.
	 The compilation now is clean of warnings.

3. Line 234 exceeded, fixed.

Those 2 lines are the only lines that were changed.
