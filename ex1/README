===================================

Task 1:
======
The program "WhatIDo" creates a directory "Welcome" with the syscall 
"mkdir" and inside of it another directory named "To", also with "mkdir". 
Then,  the program opens a file inside of "To", named "OS", for write only 
(O_WRONLY). The returned value 3 is the file descriptor used to "identify" 
the file, and used later in "write" to write to the file a message that says 
"If you didn't read the course guidelines, please do it now!". Then the 
program removes the file and the directories (using "unlink" and "rmdir").

Task 2:
======
The osm_init and finalizer are called before and after every other library
function. We implemented them to open and close one file for the disk 
access timing function. In the four main functions of the library we used 
the gettimeofday function to measure the time differences before and after 
the loop. In the loop we used loop unrolling, meaning in each iteration we 
added 5 more independent operation, excluding the one that we wanted to time. 
The reason for that is decreasing the assembly-language code meant to check 
the loop condition, so it would not affect the time measuring of the wanted 
operation. The 6 operation inside the loop are independent, so they would, 
as well, not affect the time measuring by decreasing the delay on the machine
pipline. We returned the time differnce between the two calls of gettimeofday, 
divided by the number of the iterations to get the average time.

*Notice that we counted on the user to use osm_init and osm_finalizer before
 and after using the library, and hence we started with "fclose" operation
 and ended with "fopen" in the osm_disk_time loop , knowing that the file
 will be open and closed properly.
